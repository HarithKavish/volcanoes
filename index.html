                <h2>Introduction to Volcanoes</h2>
                <div class="intro-content">
                    <p>Volcanoes are among the most awe-inspiring and powerful natural phenomena on Earth. These geological formations are formed by the movement of tectonic plates, which create openings in the Earth's crust through which molten rock, known as magma, can escape. Volcanoes can range from gentle slopes to steep, cone-shaped mountains, and they can erupt in various ways, from gentle steam vents to explosive eruptions that can devastate entire regions.</p>
                    <p>Volcanoes play a crucial role in shaping the Earth's surface. Over millions of years, they contribute to the formation of soil, provide essential minerals, and even influence climate patterns. Despite their destructive power, volcanoes also offer valuable resources and have been a source of inspiration in human culture and mythology.</p>

                        <h3>Shield Volcanoes</h3>
                        <p>Shield volcanoes are characterized by their broad, gently sloping profiles. They form from the low-viscosity lava that can travel long distances. Examples include Mauna Loa in Hawaii and Kilauea, which are known for their frequent, relatively gentle eruptions.</p>

                        <p>Stratovolcanoes are steep, symmetrical mountains composed of alternating layers of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. They are known for their explosive eruptions and include famous examples like Mount St. Helens in the United States and Mount Fuji in Japan.</p>

                        <h3>Cinder Cone Volcanoes</h3>
                        <p>Cinder cone volcanoes are smaller and steeper, built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. They are typically short-lived and can erupt explosively. Examples include Parícutin in Mexico and Mount Etna's smaller cones in Sicily.</p>

                <div class="formation-content">
                    <p>Volcanoes form primarily at plate boundaries where tectonic plates move and interact. There are three main types of plate boundaries associated with volcanic activity:</p>

                        <div class="formation-item">
                            <h3>Divergent Boundaries</h3>
                            <p>At divergent boundaries, tectonic plates move apart, creating openings where magma can rise to the surface, forming mid-ocean ridges and rift valleys.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="formation-item">
                            <h3>Convergent Boundaries</h3>
                            <p>At convergent boundaries, one plate moves beneath another, causing the subducting plate to melt and form magma. This process leads to the formation of stratovolcanoes and island arcs.</p>

                        <div class="formation-item">
                            <h3>Hot Spots</h3>
                            <p>Hot spots occur where mantle plumes rise from deep within the Earth. These plumes can create volcanic activity far from plate boundaries, such as the Hawaiian Islands.</p>
